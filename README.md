piccolo : /ˈpɪkəloʊ/ : ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Speaker_Icon.svg/16px-Speaker_Icon.svg.png) [audio](https://www.vocabolaudio.com/it/piccolo) : small, little; as in "piccolo mondo" (little world), or "[Piccolo Teatro di Milano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piccolo_Teatro_(Milan))"

## motivation
[piccolo](https://github.com/landru27/piccolo) is a 3D 6DoF engine for modeling a small world.  I intend to use piccolo as the display engine for projects of my own, and I humbly offer it to the world as a starting point for others' projects.

My first project will be an interactive environment where people can learn to program.  I also have a long-running desire to create the kind of exploration and survival game that I would enjoy playing.  And, I hope to use piccolo as a visualization tool.  I welcome contributions to this project, and am eager to see in what directions others take this work.  If you do fork this project and improve it, please consider contributing those improvements as PRs back to this project as well.

In addition to practical uses, software is a medium for art.  Mathematicians already know that there is deep beauty in numbers, and programmers already know that there is deep beauty in algorithms.  Visualization can help bring these truths and this beauty to the surface, for those outside these fields.  Think of images of [the Mandelbrot set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set), or [the Julia set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set).  In addition to this aspect, software can be just the same as the painter's brush or the sculptor's chisel.  Software can be utilized to create something expressive, something intended to resonate with others.  Just as writing and film are two different art forms each with their own expressive modes and techniques (compare, for example, _2001: A Space Odyssey_ as the book and the film), software offers yet other modes and techniques.  Logic, randomness, interaction, state-change, repetition, emergent behavior, and other facets of running software offer a new kind of palette and a new kind of medium for expression, reflection, celebration, connection, and all that art provides for us as humans, as people.  Equally so, the assets that comprise a simulated environment, from 3D models to backdrops to soundscapes, are works of fine art in their own right, and a display engine provides a place to exhibit them.

As well, a capable display environment can present art more directly, as a fine art sculpted in 3D models, painted in pixels, and heard through compelling voices and sounds.  While the best works of art have always been evocative, the dynamic and immersive 3D environment offers a new frontier for evoking connection and fostering understanding at a deep level.  Hence we have interactive novels, or the thoughtful and poignant [Home is Where One Starts ...](https://homeiswhereonestarts.wordpress.com/), among others.

Thus, my motivation is to provide myself and, perhaps, the wider world, a way to produce a wide variety of practical and creative works which call for 3D display.

Contributions are welcome!  I am currently adding core features.  I have some specific plans for implementing these features, and I hope to proceed rapidly.  Still, I welcome contributions.  Bugfixes are always welcome, as are optimizations.  I am also eager to see in what directions others take this work.  If you do fork this project and improve it, please consider contributing those improvements as PRs back to this project as well.

Models, textures, sound effects, music, and other assets for a demonstrator application would also be welcome.  A demo project will be necessary to show how to use `piccolo`, and as a springboard for others to start their own projects.

Financial contributions would also be welcome, and I am considering setting up a Patreon page when this project is a bit more mature.

All contributions would become part of the `piccolo` project, licensed under [MPLv2](../main/LICENSE).
