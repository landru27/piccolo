          <p>Demo One : an icosahedron</p>
          <p>This demo application shows piccolo running at its most basic.  The displayed icosahedron is an icosphere, but at zero orders of tessellation -- in other words, none.  An engine like piccolo is hardly needed to display an icosahedron in three.js; indeed, there is a three.js class for just such a thing.  But as a demonstrator, this demo serves the purpose of showing a very basic piccolo instance.</p>

          <p>Demo Two : an icosphere with other polyhedra orbiting</p>
          <p>This demo is more involved than the first one.  Here, the piccolo world has 6 levels of tessellation.  In addition, this demo universe has entities in addition to the piccolo world itself.  This demonstrates the separation between piccolo as an engine for modeling a small world and the other things that might occupy that world. </p>
