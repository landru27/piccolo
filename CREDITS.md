# credits
This work has benefited from the work of others.  Here I have listed some of my sources of inspiration, information, assets, and advice.  There is in fact a large community of people willing and eager to share their knowledge and explorations of software construction in general and game development in particular.  I encourage you to hunt around for resources that match with what you aim to do and how you prefer to work.  The ones listed here are the ones that suited the work on this project.

I also encourage you to support those projects that you can.  It's a great way to give back to those who are energetic, enthusiastic, and skilled enough to share with us, the broader public community, what they have learned and how they learned it.
