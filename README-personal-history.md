## a brief history
`piccolo` is my umpteenth attempt at a 3D 6DoF display engine.  I have been chasing 3D environment modeling since high school in the mid 1980s.  I vividly remember being captivated by the 3D display of the original [Wizardry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizardry:_Proving_Grounds_of_the_Mad_Overlord) game.  As crude as it was, it conveyed the _sense_ of walking in a dungeon, and fired my imagination for what could be possible.  That was 35+ years ago, and what is feasible today is worlds away from what was conceivable then; clearly I am not the only one motivated by this pursuit.

My personal project history includes a number of starter projects aimed at 3D modeling.  Nor am I alone in this, as the Internet abounds with such projects.  My first project was -- believe it or not -- done in Microsoft BASIC for the Mac, and actually worked, although unsurprisingly ran terribly slowly.  In some ways, it was better than Wizardry, however, since surfaces were displayed at any angle, not just those evenly divisible by 90&deg;.  I eagerly devoured [Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice (2nd ed.), by Foley, van Dam, Feiner, and Hughes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Graphics:_Principles_and_Practice).  I wrote a simple 3D 6DoF engine in C using X11 for graphics shortly after college, and one as a pure Java 1.1 applet shortly after that, aiming for widespread portability.

In the meantime, games such as [Doom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game)), [Quake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_(video_game)), and [The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_II:_Daggerfall) had come out.  Immersive 3D games were becoming a reality.  Always a side interest of mine, and competing with my primary responsibilities and other side interests, advances in 3D graphics far outpaced my ability to keep up.  It seemed in fact that these advances in 3D graphics capabilities made it more and more the case that successful games were driven by content -- such as art, voice talent, soundscapes, narrative, etc. -- and thus became the domain of studios.  What seemed challenging came to seem impossible, but for entirely non-technical reasons.  I became disuaded.

Much later, when my kids started playing Minecraft, and when I learned about its origins as an indie game from a sole developer, I found my imagination reignited.  Naturally, I started my renewed research by playing Minecraft.  A **lot** of Minecraft.

I enjoy [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/), but its survival mechanics are rather thin.  Having the arrogance of a programmer, I reasoned that I could improve upon it.  I briefly looked into Minecraft modding, but was turned off by the cumbersome build cycle.  Again, and especially since the early changes I wanted to make were small, in my arrogance I undertook to alter Minecraft itself.  This led me into a delightful and satisfying exploration of Java bytecode engineering, and in the end I had a hacked version of vanilla Minecraft with nerfed Creepers, an OP sword, crops that require better tending, dogs that don't stay so damn close, and elytra that exhibit powered flight instead of just gliding.  Alas, even the elytra hack was tiny compared to reworking the survival mechanics.  The changes I really wanted to make would require a more extensive approach.

I looked into several open source alternatives, such as [Minetest](https://www.minetest.net/), [Terasology](https://terasology.org/), [Craft](https://github.com/fogleman/Craft), [Voxelands](https://www.voxelands.com/), [Stonecraft](https://mrcerealguy.itch.io/stonecraft), and [Chunk Stories](http://chunkstories.xyz/), with the idea of implementing my own preferences for a survival system.  Each is in fact a fine alternative, and each has its strengths.  But, the survival changes I had in mind generally rippled outward to crafting, skill, item, and inventory changes, and it began to seem like a whole engine project afterall.  And, the blocky style of Minecraft-like voxel-based games is not my first choice.

In the search for good survival games, I found and was drawn to [Eco](https://www.strangeloopgames.com/eco/) and [The Long Dark](http://www.thelongdark.com/).  These are outstanding games, and I enjoy them a lot.  They provide satisfying game play, but the programmer in me yearns to build.

The spark of inspiration for this project in particular was [Equilinox](https://store.steampowered.com/app/853550/Equilinox/), a true gem of a game.  Equilinox is wonderful.  It's fun, satisfying, and beautifully rendered.  While not a survival game, it does have the dynamic of building something sustainable.  It shows how a well-executed low-poly style can be compelling, without the programming nor platform demands of high-end, highly realistic graphics.

I worked through the [LWJGLv2 tutorial series by ThinMatrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VS8wlS9hF8E&feature=youtu.be&list=PLRIWtICgwaX0u7Rf9zkZhLoLuZVfUksDP), and found that robust and meaningful 3D programming was still possible after all, and found many more examples of indie game developers making a go of it.  I also followed along with the code development of ThinMatrix's Equilinox.  This was inspiring, both from a programming perspective, and from the perspective of the final product.

Before starting `piccolo`, I made an attempt in Unity, and was simultaneously dazzled by its options and frustrated by its restrictions.

Looking back, one common theme for why my earlier projects did not go further is that I was very focused on the engine itself, the result of which was that I obsessed about realism.  Without something to use the engine _for_, there was no context for knowing what would be _good enough_.  The other main problem is that I did not discover the profound benefits of iterative improvement until rather late in my software engineering career.  (One can hardly blame me, coming of age in a time where formalism in software design prevailed.)  In other words, to quote Voltaire (who himself quoted an Italian proverb), I had made what is best the enemy of what is good.

I would enjoy crafting a survival game to my exact likings, but I hesitate to put so much effort into something so tuned to my own preferences, and I'm not sure the world needs another survival game.  But what I do feel the world needs is better ways for people to learn programming.  I am convinced it will become a 21st-century skill, the way that typing used to be a skill only office secretaries needed to learn but which is taken for granted these days for all office workers, since we are all expected to use a computer, e-mail, word processors, etc.  I predict that in the near future, most software will have script-like capabilities, and people will be expected to be able to write 'programs' to automate routine tasks.  With that concrete purpose for using a 3D display engine, I have the substrate for shaping the engine, for making pragmatic decisions about what features and improvements to focus on.

Ultimately, I would like this to be a 3D engine that can stand on its own, and serve as the core for various kinds of games and other projects.  In no way is this ever going to compete with the likes of [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) or [jMonkeyEngine](http://jmonkeyengine.org/) or [Godot](https://godotengine.org/).  But if I can use it for a handful of projects of my own, then it will have been a success.  If others contribute to and/or utilize `piccolo` for their own successful projects, then, well, that would be quite satisfying as well.
