# Code of Conduct
[![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-v2.0%20adopted-ff69b4.svg)](code_of_conduct.md)

## purpose
The leadership of the [piccolo](https://github.com/landru27/piccolo) project are committed to providing a safe, welcoming, constructive, and productive environment for all people.  All people, period.

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.  This code of conduct is to be read as a guide for how we can each shape participation in the project and this community into an enriching, growthful, and encouraging experience.  The specifics stated here are important, but not exhaustive.  The spirit and global intent conveyed here are the deciding factors in how to interpret, understand, and apply this code of conduct.

We invite all those who participate in the [piccolo](https://github.com/landru27/piccolo) project to foster the environment we value and for which we strive.  We honor those who make the effort to ensure our community meets our ideals.

## our pledge
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, healthy, enriching, growthful, encouraging, constructive, and productive community.

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to do our utmost, as individuals and by working together, to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone in the community.  We do not list specific categories of persons we might encounter; we need to ask ourselves one, single question : is the person I am dealing with a person?  The answer is yes; and so this code of conduct applies to each and to all of our interactions.

## our standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to the sort of environment we pledge to foster for our community include:

* Acting with integrity and in good faith at all times
* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of the differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences of others
* Being confident in the respectfulness of others toward ourselves in our own differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Recognizing that cultural differences are real, and our culture is part of who we are, for each of us
* Respectfully giving constructive feedback
* Gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Participation in an authentic and active way, contributing thereby to the health and longevity of this community
* Exercising and fostering collaboration
* De-escalating community tensions by seeking common ground and provisionally disengaging from points of impasse
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
* Recognizing that even though the community would not exist if not for the project, the project is nothing without the community
* Speaking up when you witness unacceptable behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* Violence, threats of violence, or violent language directed against another person or persons, whether or not they are members of this community
* Demeaning, derogatory, discriminatory, insulting, disruptive, or harassing behavior and/or speech, whether public or private
* Sexualized language or imagery
* Sexual attention or advances of any kind (members may of course have private relationships amongst one another, separate from their participation in this community)
* Publishing others' private information / doxing
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
* Advocating for and/or encouraging any sort of unacceptable behavior by another person
* Threatening to take any action which, if enacted, would be considered unacceptable behavior (yes: that's recursive ...)
* Staying silent when you witness unacceptable behavior
* False and/or bad-faith reports of unacceptable behavior

## enforcement responsibilities

> Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take prompt, appropriate, and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and the responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, documentation edits, issues, and any other contributions that they deem are not aligned to this code of conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when feasible, practical, and appropriate.

## enforcement
Breaches of our community standards should be promptly reported to the community leadership.  See the **contact / community leadership** section, below.  Such breaches should be reported by anyone who is party to the breach, or witness to the breach.  All complaints will be handled promptly, appropriately, and fairly.  All breaches that warrant the involvement of police authorities must also be reported to the police, by the victim(s), witness(es), and leadership.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the safety, security, and privacy of anyone reporting an incident, as well as all parties involved in the consequent investigation.

## enforcement guidelines
Community leaders will follow the following community impact guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this code of conduct.  Final interpretation, determination, and enforcement remains at the discretion of the community leadership, but equally so, the community leadership remains held to the same standards as the broader community as outlined in this code of conduct.

### 1. correction
**community impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. Two-way, good-faith communication between leadership and the offender demonstrating an understanding of the violation and a positive path forward. A public apology might be requested.

### 2. warning
**community impact**: A violation or closely related series of violations of community standards.

**consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved for a specified period of time, except potentially through moderation, if all parties agree on such moderation. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels such as social media. Violating these terms may be considered grounds for a more severe violation.

### 3. temporary ban
**community impact**: A serious violation of community standards, such as sustained inappropriate behavior, or violating the constraints of a warning.

**consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the code of conduct, is allowed during this period.  Violating these terms may be considered grounds for a more severe violation.  

### 4. permanent ban
**community impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, such as sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of any individual or group, aggression toward or disparagement of any individual or group, or violating the constraints of a temporary ban.

**consequence**: A permanent and total ban from the community.

## scope
This code of conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.  Members must have clear and explicit permission from community leaders in order to officially represent this project and/or our community.

## contact / community leadership
In this early stage of the project, the leadership consists of just the author, [Andrew Witt](mailto:landru729@gmail.com).
